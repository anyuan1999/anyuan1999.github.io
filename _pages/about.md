- I am currently a Ph.D student at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, supervised by Prof  [Li Yang](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/yangli/). My current research interests focus on system security and software security including provenance-based intrusion detection systems, malware detection, large language model and graph representation learning.
